AppBnb is a feature-rich clone of the popular vacation rental platform, AirBnB. With AppBnb, users have the capability to list their properties and leave reviews after their stay. The development of this project was a great opportunity to work with Express and utilize Heroku for deployment, providing a comprehensive experience in the web development process.
