Punchender is a group project that serves as a replica of the popular crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter. It provided valuable experience in working in a team setting, particularly with regard to pushing changes to a git repository and coordinating the development of different components. Additionally, the project served as an opportunity to transition from using Render to deploying the application on Heroku.
